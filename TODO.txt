0. child specifier for TileRandomizer to allow nested inventories

0.9. consider passing tilestack to the render function
1. consider moving maxQuantity to model
2.5. rename commondata to shareddata?

PROBABLY NEXT:
3. projectile system (structure similar to entity system), projectiles for melee weapons and other things like arrows.
3.1 WeaponTileController - arrows use that to
3.1.1 parametrised by projectile to spawn on attack request or ammo type (then ammo is requested from entity and if it matches then attack if deferred to that ammo) (weapons can have multiple valid ammo types)
3.1.2 ammo types (probably runtime integer)
3.1.3 attack request for tile controller takes attacking entity and world
3.2 projectiles should not be hard bound to entities because projectile may outlive its owner
3.2.1 projectiles should receive event when owner is deleted because some things may still rely on owner.
3.3 projectiles receive a parent entity and hinted position through onProjectileInstantiated function (and therfore instantiate too) that is called from Projectile

7. Clear world generation code //little priority since it is waiting for libs still

15. Pass RenderStates by CONST reference
19. Make camera like the one in Carcassone. Move there everything involving camera (for example conversion between coordinates)

24. player's line of sight using raycasting

IMPORTANT
100.1 store normal textures and meta textures in one texture side to side (offset by 0.5) (or some king of 3d texture if possible)
100.2 make world drawing cleaner, parametrize intermidiate targets' sizes
100.3 increase 'tile height' range from 32 to 64 to allow tiles that spread on 2x2 - also requires changes in shader and more drawing range
100.4 make it possible for tiles to specify what size they are (1 - 1x1, 2 - 2x2, more should not be needed)

101. try dim light depending on height from the ground

102. '%' sign missing in tibia font
