0. child specifier for TileRandomizer to allow nested inventories

0.9. consider passing tilestack to the render function
1. consider moving maxQuantity to model
2.5. rename commondata to shareddata?

7. Clear world generation code //little priority since it is waiting for libs still

15. Pass RenderStates by CONST reference
19. Make camera like the one in Carcassone. Move there everything involving camera (for example conversion between coordinates)

24. player's line of sight using raycasting

IMPORTANT
100.1 store normal textures and meta textures in one texture side to side (offset by 0.5) (or some king of 3d texture if possible)
100.2 make world drawing cleaner, parametrize intermidiate targets' sizes
100.3 increase 'tile height' range from 32 to 64 to allow tiles that spread on 2x2 - also requires changes in shader and more drawing range
100.4 make it possible for tiles to specify what size they are (1 - 1x1, 2 - 2x2, more should not be needed)

101. try dim light depending on height from the ground
