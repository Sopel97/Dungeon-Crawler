IMPOERTANT:
- merge controllers and models because they are hardly separable

- mark common data pointers const ?

- Clear world generation code //little priority since it is waiting for libs still

- Make camera like the one in Carcassone. Move there everything involving camera (for example conversion between coordinates)

- restructure TileTransferMediator, make it cleaner

- better interface in map and inventory regarding actions that should cause events (currently onTilePlaced, onTileRemoved). Mainly make it safer and easier to work with.

- unify tile location

- TileDescriptionGenerator should query additional (only information) attributes and description from tile instead of building it itself (like capacity, later potion time etc.)

- when tile is placed in world or moved to it/within it it remembers all tiles that are potential light sources (divide the world to a grid, like 32x32 or something for faster lookup) and query lights for rendering
-- needs revision on how these events are generated. Make it so they arise in possibly as few places as possible
-- possibly have a number for each tile that specifies how much light that is emitted by tile somewhere below is blocked (reduces radius by factor (sum of all reductions | max reduction))

- window resizing (should be done fully by the window being resized. Relying only on min,max size parameters)

DRAWING RELATED, kinda important
- make world drawing cleaner, parametrize intermidiate targets' sizes

- make it possible for tiles to specify what size they are (1 - 1x1, 2 - 2x2, more should not be needed)

- try dim light depending on height from the ground
- player's line of sight using raycasting

- '%' sign missing in tibia font
