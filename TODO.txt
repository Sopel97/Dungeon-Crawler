- try to change  InventorySlotView::tileSize to 1.0

-- eventually encapsulate compontents in Tile, Entity, Projectile o they are not visible from outside

- Clear world generation code //little priority since it is waiting for libs still

- Make camera like the one in Carcassone. Move there everything involving camera (for example conversion between coordinates)

- remove out of bounds tile from tile column?

- restructure TileTransferMediator, make it cleaner

- replace InventorySlotView with InventorySlotLocation where drawing is not needed

- check if loot can be placed on the tile, if not search for possible location nearby

- make using a tile return something, for example that the item should be transformed to be something else (try insert it to inventory, leave on the ground), or just used, and more requests that tile can't do on it's own and are somewhat generic and common

CONSIDER:
hook up StaticEmbeddedHomogenousMemoryPool for components, tiles, entities, projectiles, see how it behaves

- group tile (and entity, and projectile) flags in one place (struct with bitfields or something)

- continue to make better interface in (world) map and inventory (if something old that should be removed or changed pops up) regarding actions that should cause events (currently onTilePlaced, onTileRemoved). Mainly make it safer and easier to work with.

- consider using ls::Vec2I/ls::Vec3I to pass tile coordinates

- when tile is placed in world or moved to it/within it it remembers all tiles that are potential light sources (divide the world to a grid, like 32x32 or something for faster lookup) and query lights for rendering
-- needs revision on how these events are generated. Make it so they arise in possibly as few places as possible
-- possibly have a number for each tile that specifies how much light that is emitted by tile somewhere below is blocked (reduces radius by factor (sum of all reductions | max reduction))

- window resizing (should be done fully by the window being resized. Relying only on min,max size parameters)

DRAWING RELATED, kinda important
- make world drawing cleaner, parametrize intermidiate targets' sizes

- make it possible for tiles to specify what size they are (1 - 1x1, 2 - 2x2, more should not be needed)

- try dim light depending on height from the ground
- player's line of sight using raycasting

- '%' sign missing in tibia font
