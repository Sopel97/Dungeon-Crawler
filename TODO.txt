- merge controllers and models because they are hardly separable

- Clear world generation code //little priority since it is waiting for libs still

- Pass RenderStates by CONST reference
- Make camera like the one in Carcassone. Move there everything involving camera (for example conversion between coordinates)

- player's line of sight using raycasting

- window resizing (should be done fully by the window being resized. Relying only on min,max size parameters)

DRAWING RELATED, kinda important
- make world drawing cleaner, parametrize intermidiate targets' sizes
- increase 'tile height' range from 32 to 64 to allow tiles that spread on 2x2 - also requires changes in shader and more drawing range
- make it possible for tiles to specify what size they are (1 - 1x1, 2 - 2x2, more should not be needed)

- try dim light depending on height from the ground

- '%' sign missing in tibia font

- clean up tall drawables and everything related (may not be needed at all if depth buffer approach works as expected)
